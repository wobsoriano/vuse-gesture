# Getting started

â€ŒğŸ–– vuse-gesture is a set of gestures that let you bind mouse and touch events to any node.

With the data you receive, it becomes easy to set up complex gestures like dragging and pinching with a few lines of code.

::: info
This set of composables is a port of [@use-gesture/react](https://use-gesture.netlify.app/).

## Installation

$ pnpm add vuse-gesture
```
